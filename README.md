#### Description
Movie App is a personal application that could be described as an archive of movies. Movie App was designed with the ability to organize and personalize a collection of movies as a user see's fit, for constant referrals. Movie App is great for storing favorite movies or even queue movies to watch later. Movie App, simply put, is documentation of movie history in a display that is visually pleasing.

The application utilizes *OMDB API* to leverage their vast collections of movies from their database. allowing the users to interact with the API in a format that is extremely user friendly from the simplicity of a search bar. The user can maneuver the database for a specific movie by title which returns a movie poster. The poster along with other movie details is then stored to Movie Appâ€™s *Glitch* database powered by *node js* for reference at any time.  Movie app was developed to provide the movie collections back in several customizable categories starting with genres such as action, drama, horor, sci-fi, ect, favorites, and watch later.

#### Technologies
The **Front-End Technologies** that make all the magic  possible are *JavaScript* which enables the responsiveness of features like rendering of data asynchronously, and *JQuery* for efficient traversal around the application and as well as within *OMDB API*. The User Interface foundation is *Bootstrap5* for its grid system allowing precise positioning of the data onto the page. Lastly, *CSS4* which makes the application unique in its own merit improves user experience tremendously.

The **Back-End Technologies** used as mentioned is *Glitch* for the creation of the *node js* database to capture the personalized data of movies. Using Gltich made helding data fairly seemless. Glitch also assisted in forming accurate load times by outputing the data at random increments. This was extremely tough for us simply because this was the first time either of us dealt with loading. Being able to customize the time of data helped us imporive our skills with loads.
